Royal couple watch nation's mood

<n>Prince Charles</n> and <n>Camilla Parker Bowles</n> are awaiting the nation's reaction after announcing they are to be married on 8 April.

<n>Mrs Parker Bowles</n> will take the title HRH Duchess of Cornwall after a civil ceremony to be held at Windsor Castle. A Daily Telegraph poll of 1,313 people suggests two-thirds of Britons support the couple's decision to marry. But only 40% think <n>Mrs Parker Bowles</n> should become Princess Consort as planned after Charles becomes king. Some 47% believe she should have no title, while 7% think she should become queen.

The poll also found that the majority of Britons would prefer the monarchy to miss a generation, with the Queen handing the throne to her grandson <n>Prince William</n>, 22, on her death or abdication. On Thursday night, <n>Prince Charles</n>, 56, and <n>Mrs Parker Bowles</n>, 57, hosted a dinner at Windsor Castle, their first public appearance since announcing their engagement. <n>Mrs Parker Bowles</n> said the prince went down on one knee to propose and added: "I'm just coming down to earth." She displayed her diamond engagement ring - a Royal Family heirloom - to reporters. Charles said he and his wife-to-be were "absolutely delighted". Their marriage will end years of speculation on a relationship which dates back to 1970.

The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh said the news had made them "very happy". <n>Princes William</n> and <n>Harry</n> said they are "very happy" and wish the couple "all the luck in the future". The wedding will be a civil ceremony followed by a service of prayer and dedication in <n>St George's</n> Chapel at which the Archbishop of Canterbury, <n>Dr Rowan Williams</n>, will preside.

The marriage is likely to be a sensitive issue because <n>Mrs Parker Bowles</n> is divorced and her former husband is still alive. If he became king, <n>Charles</n> would be the supreme governor of the Church of England and some Anglicans remain opposed to the remarriage of divorcees. "His divorce from <n>Diana</n> and the disappointment the country felt over how <n>Diana</n> had been treated... opened up a sense of disillusionment with [<n>Prince Charles</n>]," said <n>Ros Coward</n>, who wrote the authorised biography of <n>Diana</n>, princess of Wales. The Archbishop of Canterbury said: "I am pleased that <n>Prince Charles</n> and <n>Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles</n> have decided to take this important step." <n>Tony Blair</n> said he was "delighted" for the couple and offered his congratulations, as did Conservative leader <n>Michael Howard</n> and Liberal Democrat leader <n>Charles Kennedy</n>. Australia's Prime Minister <n>John Howard</n> also offered his congratulations, adding that their decision to marry was a "sensible and a good thing". Mrs Parker Bowles has joined the prince at numerous engagements in recent years - mostly at evening events for The Prince's Trust. Clarence House staff were at pains to point out that she attended these events in a private capacity.
