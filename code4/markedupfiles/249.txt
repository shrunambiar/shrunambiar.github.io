No election TV debate, says Blair

<n>Tony Blair</n> has said he will not take part in a TV debate with his political rivals ahead of the next election.

"We answer this every election campaign and, for the reasons I have given before, the answer is no," he said at his monthly news conference. In October Tory leader <n>Michael Howard</n> said <n>Mr Blair</n> would be running scared if he refused calls to go head-to-head. In recent years the leader of the opposition has always called for a debate, although it has never happened. Before the 2001 election, plans for a debate between <n>Mr Blair</n>, <n>William Hague</n> and <n>Charles Kennedy</n> collapsed. In 1997 a debate between <n>Mr Blair</n> and <n>John Major</n> was also cancelled when a format could not be agreed. Televised debates have become the high point of the US presidential election campaigns.
