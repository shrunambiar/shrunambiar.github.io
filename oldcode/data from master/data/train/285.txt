<n>Hague</n> 'given up' his PM ambition

Former Conservative leader <n>William Hague</n> says he will not stand for the leadership again, having given up his ambition to be prime minister.

<n>Mr Hague</n>, 43, told the Daily Telegraph he would now find a life dominated by politics too "boring" and unfulfilling. <n>Mr Hague</n>, who stepped down after his party's 2001 election defeat, does not rule out a return to the front bench. He also told the paper he hopes to remain MP for Richmond, North Yorks, and start a family with wife <n>Ffion</n>. <n>Mr Hague</n>, who recently had published the biography of <n>William Pitt</n> the Younger, also said he wanted to continue writing books and speech-writing.

He told the newspaper: "I don't know whether I will ever go back on to the front, but don't rush me." Asked if he would stand for the leadership again, <n>Mr Hague</n> replied: "No. Definitely not." His determination to stay away from a central role will disappoint some senior Conservative members, who say the party needs him. <n>Tim Collins</n>, the shadow education secretary, said last week it would be a "huge boost" to the party if <n>Mr Hague</n> returned to the front bench. <n>Mr Hague</n> became an MP at 27 and Leader of the Opposition at 36. He said: "I feel fortunate that, by the age of 40, I had crammed in an entire political career. "I had been in the Cabinet and been leader of the party, so now I can branch out into other things...it is a very liberating feeling." <n>Mr Hague</n> added that he may have misjudged his own ambition to be prime minister. "Maybe I wasn't as driven by politics as I thought I was," he said.
