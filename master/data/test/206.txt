<n>Blair's</n> hope for <n>Blunkett</n> return

The events leading to <n>David Blunkett's</n> resignation must not "swept under the carpet", the Tories have warned.

On Wednesday <n>Tony Blair</n> said he hoped the former home secretary would serve again in government in the future. <n>Mr Blunkett</n> quit in December after a probe linked him to the visa application of his ex-lover's nanny. <n>Mr Blair</n> said he left "without a stain on his character" but Tory <n>Dominic Grieve</n> branded the way <n>Mr Blunkett's</n> office operated as "scandalous". <n>Mr Blair</n> told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I know <n>David</n> very well and I believe him to be a man of real integrity and real ability and I was very sad for him as to what happened."

He said <n>Mr Blunkett<n> still had an immense amount to offer the country but he was not making any "guarantees or definitive statements" about future jobs. But shadow attorney general <n>Mr Grieve</n> said: "While I don't rule out the possibility that <n>Mr Blunkett</n> may return as a minister, I don't think it's something that can simply be brushed under the carpet." Senior Labour backbencher <n>Martin O'Neill</n>, who chairs the Commons trade committee, said he believed the prime minister would want one of his "praetorian guard" - a reference to the elite body guard of Roman emperors - back alongside him. But colleague <n>Ian Gibson</n>, who chairs the science and technology committee, said there was a "question mark" as to whether <n>Mr Blunkett</n> could serve at cabinet level again.
