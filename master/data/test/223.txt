<n>Kennedy</n> questions trust of <n>Blair</n>

Lib Dem leader <n>Charles Kennedy</n> has said voters now have a "fundamental lack of trust" of <n>Tony Blair</n> as prime minister.

He said backing his party was not a wasted vote, adding that with the Lib Dems "what you see is what you get". He made his comments at the start of a day of appearances on Channel Five in a session on The Wright Stuff programme. Questions from callers, a studio audience and the show's presenter covered Lib Dem tax plans, anti-terror laws and immigration.

<n>Mr Kennedy</n> said during his nearly 22 years in Parliament he had seen prime ministers and party leaders come and go and knew the pitfalls of British politics. "1983 was when I was first elected as an MP - so <n>Tony Blair</n>, <n>Michael Howard</n> and myself were all class of '83 - and over that nearly quarter of a century the world has changed out of recognition," he said. "We don't actually hear the argument any longer: 'Lib Dems, good people, reasonable ideas but only if we thought they could win around here - it's a wasted vote'. "You don't hear that because the evidence of people's senses demonstrates that it isn't a wasted vote." But he said <n>Mr Blair</n> had lost the trust of the British people. "There is a fundamental lack of trust in <n>Tony Blair</n> as prime minister and in his government," he said.

"What we've got to do as a party - what I've got to do as a leader of this party - is to convey to people that what you see is what you get." <n>Mr Kennedy</n> also used his TV appearance to defend his party's plans to increase income tax to 50% for those earning more than Â£100,000, saying it would apply to just 1% of the population. He said the extra revenue would allow his party to get rid of tuition and top-up fees, introduce free personal care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax. <n>Mr Blair</n> has already spent a day with Five and <n>Michael Howard</n> is booked for a similar session.
