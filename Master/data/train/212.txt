Tory expert denies defeatism

The Conservatives' campaign director has denied a report claiming he warned <n>Michael Howard</n> the party could not win the next general election.

The Times on Monday said Australian <n>Lynton Crosby</n> told the party leader to focus on trying to increase the Tories' Commons presence by 25 to 30 seats. But <n>Mr Crosby</n> said in a statement: "I have never had any such conversation... and I do not hold that view." <n>Mr Howard</n> later added there was not "one iota" of truth in the report. The strategist helped Australia's PM, <n>John Howard</n>, win four elections. <n>Mr Howard</n> appointed <n>Mr Crosby</n> as his elections chief last October. <n>Mr Crosby's</n> statement said: "The Conservative Party has been making an impact on the issues of lower tax and controlled immigration over the past week." It added: "The Labour Party will be wanting to do all they can to distract attention away from the issues that really matter to people."
