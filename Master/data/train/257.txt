<n>Blair</n> and <n>Brown</n> criticised by MPs

Labour MPs have angrily criticised <n>Tony Blair</n> and <n>Gordon Brown</n> amid renewed reports of a rift between the two men.

A meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party saw a succession of normally loyal members warn that feuding could jeopardise Labour's election hopes. The PM insisted nothing would derail Labour's campaign, despite a new book saying he has upset his chancellor by backing out of a pledge to stand aside. <n>Mr Brown</n> will again be in the public eye at the party's new poster launch. In what the party had hoped would be perceived as a show of unity, he is due to line up alongside <n>Alan Milburn</n> - the man controversially appointed as the party's election supremo - and deputy leader <n>John Prescott</n> for the event in London on Tuesday. Relations between <n>Mr Brown</n> and <n>Mr Milburn</n> are widely reported to be cool ever since <n>Mr Blair</n> brought the latter back into the Cabinet to run Labour's election campaign, a role successfully carried out by <n>Mr Brown</n> in both 1997 and 2001.

<n>Mr Blair</n> told the Parliamentary Labour Party on Monday: "I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need."

The prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other for the meeting of the PLP and were seemingly in good spirits as it started. New speculation about the state of their relationship was sparked by claims in <n>Brown's</n> Britain, by Sunday Telegraph journalist <n>Robert Peston</n>, which suggested <n>Mr Blair</n> went back on a pledge to make way for <n>Mr Brown</n>. Labour's <n>Paul Flynn</n> said <n>Mr Blair</n> and <n>Mr Brown</n> had a "scorching" from MPs adding: "It was a Parliamentary Labour Party meeting like no other."

Backbencher <n>Stephen Pound</n> said some MPs had threatend to expose those fuelling the reports if <n>Mr Blair</n> and <n>Mr Brown</n> did not "stop this nonsense, this poisonous briefing". <n>Lord Campbell-Savours</n>, a former MP, challenged <n>Mr Brown</n> to deny reports that he had told the prime minister he did not believe anything he said. <n>Mr Prescott</n> said MPs were entitled to complain about discipline after reading recent press reports.

"They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line," he told BBC Radio 4's Today on Tuesday. <n>Mr Prescott</n> said there were occasional disagreements in any government. But he argued <n>Mr Blair</n> and <n>Mr Brown</n> could work successfully together and had produced a strong economy and better public services.

The new book claims <n>Mr Prescott</n> hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told <n>Mr Brown</n> he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war. He had then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from Cabinet allies and suspicion that the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes <n>Mr Peston</n>. <n>Mr Prescott</n> said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential. "Of course as a waiter for 10 years I have a professional ability here," he joked. <n>Mr Blair</n> has insisted he has done no deals over the premiership while <n>Mr Brown</n> says he will not let "gossip" distract him from helping a unified election campaign. The Conservatives say the two men are behaving like squabbling schoolboys and the Liberal Democrats claim personal ambition is obstructing good government.
